Before we start building networks in Tensorflow and exploring what they can do

We should probably try and do something simple

Like just processing some images

Use your study time next week to complete the following exercise

As part of week 6, which is a self-study week, you must study the following notebook.

https://github.com/ual-cci/MSc-Coding-2/blob/master/Week-6-Exercise-intro-to-image-data-and-tensorflow.ipynb

Following this, you must make a version of the notebook with at least one major difference that you have introduced yourself. First, you must do some transformation on the image dataset that isn't included in the above document. If you manage to do this, your next task is to collect and process your own dataset instead of the one provided.
