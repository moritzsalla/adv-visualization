# Instructions - submit only 4 in-class exercises!

- Choose what you consider to be your 4 best in-class exercises that you have completed as part of Coding 2.
- Submit them in CODE format with an associated README file (one README per exercise), and any associated output image files. You can submit .cpp + .hpp files, iPython notebooks, any other code in text form, and example PNG/JPEGS (images in any format).
- For each of the 4 exercises, your readme should include a 250 word description of what you did, what you feel you learned, and most importantly, how the code should be run.
- Submit your 4 in-class assignments via MOODLE alongside the 4 README files in a zip file, with legible filenames.
- If you have git repos for your projects, please simply include a link to these in your zip file.

Each assignment is located in its respective folder, alongside a readme containing an explanation and setup instructions.
