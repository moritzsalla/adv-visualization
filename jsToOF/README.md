 # Week 2 Exercise - Your first OF project
 
 - Select a JavaScript project you completed last term and port it to C++ using openFrameworks

## Setup

There is a build in the `build/bin/` directory. To run the app, simply double click on the icon.

To set up the development environment on mac, make sure to have downloaded the OF library, then import the project using the OF project manager. Be sure to have `ofxPlotter` and `ofxShader` selected, then click update. When successfully updated, a dialog will prompt you to open the project in the Xcode IDE.
