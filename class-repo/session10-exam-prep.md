# Session 10: Exam Preparation

## Part 1 - Revision

We will be doing a live revision session in order to pick up the study skills you need to take part in exams more successfully.

* Open questions exam (Mock)

Here we will look at a selection of open questions that include topics that might appear in the exam.

Your goal is to review the material from the existing class documentation and to make a single paragraph of notes on each question you are asked.

* Review

We're going to go through all the material together and talk about the answers

* Revise

At home you will revise your notes so that they fit on a single page

## Part 2 - In-class project test

* Pick a project or example that you have worked on from any of the sessions we have completed in this class this term.

* Review the project so that you are familiar with it.

* Without looking at the original project or any other material, attempt to recreate that project from scratch in a new document on the MIMIC platform. ___You must use the MIMIC platform for this test.___

* At the end of the session, send this document to me via slack.

___## NB: If you are completing a project using GLSL or THREE.JS, you do not need to write the basic management and setup code - just the GLSL parts___
* If using GLSL or THREE, the document you can fork in order to complete the examination is here:

https://mimicproject.com/code/e2fb6d1d-e5f8-a950-5119-b47535a82752

* You will be allowed to create and maintain forks of your own documents as back-ups, as long as you only send one final document link at the end of the session.
